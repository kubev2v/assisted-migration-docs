---

The Migration Advisor tool collects data about your VMware environment to help you plan your migration to OpenShift Virtualization. This document describes all the data fields included in the aggregated inventory report.

Applies to: V0.4.0  
Last update (dd-mm-yyyy): 02-02-2026

The data fields and structure described in this document may vary between releases. 
New fields may be added and deprecated fields may be removed based on the version of the Migration Advisor tool.

## Report Structure Overview

The inventory report is organized hierarchically:

```
Inventory
├── vcenter_id          # Unique identifier for the vCenter
├── vcenter             # vCenter-level aggregated data
└── clusters            # Map of cluster names to their inventory data
    └── [cluster_name]
        ├── vms         # Virtual machine statistics
        └── infra       # Infrastructure data
```

#### Disk Types

For each disk type (e.g., thin, thick, RDM), the report provides:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `vmCount` | Number of VMs with at least one disk of this type |
| `totalSizeTB` | Total disk size in TB for this disk type |

### Power States

A breakdown of VMs by their power state.

### Operating System Information

For each detected operating system, the report provides:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `count` | Number of VMs running this OS |
| `supported` | Whether the OS is supported for migration by MTV |

## Data Report Generation

The data report can be generated through two methods:

### 1. Discovery Agent (OVA installation in the VSphare environment)

When using the Discovery Agent:
- Data is collected directly from vCenter APIs
- Provides the most accurate and complete information
- Updates automatically as your environment changes
- Requires deploying the OVA appliance to your vCenter

### 2. RVTools Upload

When uploading an RVTools export:
- Data is parsed from the Excel file
- Quick assessment without deploying any agents
- Data accuracy depends on when the RVTools export was generated
- Some fields may be unavailable depending on RVTools configuration
